!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1st CodeLLM response:
  Here is the Python3 code for the function `select_words`:
```
def select_words(s, n):
    words = s.split()
    selected_words = []
    for word in words:
        if len(word) >= n:
            selected_words.append(word)
    return selected_words
```
This function first splits the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method. It then iterates over each word in the list and checks if the length of the word is greater than or equal to the input parameter `n`. If the length of the word is greater than or equal to `n`, the word is added to a new list called `selected_words`. Finally, the function returns the `selected_words` list.

Note that this function assumes that the input string `s` contains only letters and spaces. If the input string contains any other characters, the function may not work as expected.

```
def check_dict_case(dict):
    if not dict:

    lower_case_keys = [key for key in dict.keys() if key.islower()]
    upper_case_keys = [key for key in dict.keys() if key.isupper()]

This code uses list comprehensions to create two lists of keys: `lower_case_keys` and `upper_case_keys`. The `islower()` and `isupper()` methods are used to check if each key is in lower case or upper case. If either list is not empty, the function returns `True`. If both lists are empty, the function returns `False`.

Note that this function assumes that all keys in the dictionary are strings. If there are any non-string keys, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are monotonic. The `all()` function takes a generator expression as an argument, which checks if each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element. If all the elements are monotonic, then the `all()` function will return `True`. If any element is not monotonic, then the `all()` function will return `False`.

Note that this code assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, then the `all()` function will raise a `ValueError` exception. To handle this case, you can add a check for the length of the list before calling the `all()` function.

  Here is the Python3 code for the given problem:
```
def search(lst):
    max_freq = 0
    max_val = -1
    for i in lst:
        if i > 0 and lst.count(i) >= i:

                max_freq = lst.count(i)
                max_val = i
    return max_val
```
This code works by iterating through the list and checking if each element is greater than 0 and has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If such an element is found, it is stored in `max_val` and its frequency is stored in `max_freq`. The function then returns `max_val`. If no such element is found, the function returns -1.

 ### Questions:   Here is the Python3 code for the given problem:
```
def search(lst):
    max_freq = 0
    max_val = -1
    for i in lst:
        if i > 0 and lst.count(i) >= i:
            if lst.count(i) > max_freq:
                max_freq = lst.count(i)
                max_val = i
    return max_val
```
This code works by iterating through the list and checking if each element is greater than 0 and has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If such an element is found, it is stored in `max_val` and its frequency is stored in `max_freq`. The function then returns `max_val`. If no such element is found, the function returns -1.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only positive integers. If the input list is empty or contains negative integers, the function will not work correctly. 
 ### Modified Problem Description: You are an expert software developer who writes high quality code. With below information, please either generate Python3 code (Respond directly with code only with markdown), or ask clarifying questions:

    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 4
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 4

  Here is the Python3 code for the function `monotonic`:
```
def monotonic(l: list):
    if len(l) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        direction = l[1] - l[0]
        for i in range(2, len(l)):
            if l[i] - l[i-1] != direction:
                return False
        return True
```
This function uses the fact that a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing if the difference between each adjacent pair of elements is either positive or negative, but not both. It checks this by comparing the difference between each adjacent pair of elements to the direction of the first two elements in the list. If any of the differences are not equal to the direction, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

It uses the modulo operator (`%`) to extract the last digit of `n`, and then checks if it is odd using the modulo operator again. If the digit is odd, it multiplies the product by the digit. Finally, it divides `n` by 10 to move on to the next digit.

The function returns 0 if all digits are even, or the product of the odd digits if there are any.

def words_string(s):

This code splits the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method, which takes a string as an argument and returns a list of substrings. The `split()` method splits the string at each occurrence of the argument, which in this case is a comma. The resulting list is then returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a comma-separated list of words. If the input string can contain other characters or symbols, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

This code first checks if the input array is empty or has only one element, and returns an empty array or the array itself accordingly.

If the input array has more than one element, it calculates the sum of the first and last elements and checks if the sum is odd or even.

If the sum is odd, it sorts the array in descending order using the `sorted()` function with the `reverse` parameter set to `True`.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1st CodeLLM response:
  Based on the given information, it seems like the function `candidate` is supposed to take a list of integers as input and return `True` if the elements of the list are either increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an example implementation of the function in Python 3:
```
def candidate(l):
    if len(l) < 2:
        return True
    else:
        direction = l[1] - l[0]
        for i in range(2, len(l)):
            if l[i] - l[i-1] != direction:
                return False
        return True
```
This implementation uses a simple loop to check if the difference between each element and the previous element is equal to the difference between the second element and the first element. If any of these differences are not equal, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes successfully, the function returns `True`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the list contains at least two elements. If the list contains fewer than two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. If you want to handle this case, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the list contains at least two elements.

  Based on the given function signature, it seems like the function is supposed to return the value of 2^n modulo, where n is the input parameter. However, the function body is empty, so it's not clear what the function is supposed to do.

Here's an example of how you could implement this function in Python:
```
def candidate(x: int, y: int):
    return pow(2, x, y)
```
This function uses the `pow` function from the `math` module to calculate the value of 2^n modulo, where n is the input parameter `x` and the modulo is the input parameter `y`.

Alternatively, you could use the `pow` function from the `operator` module, which is a more efficient way to calculate powers:
```
from operator import pow

def candidate(x: int, y: int):
    return pow(2, x, y)
```

This code uses the fact that a string is prime if and only if it is not divisible by any number greater than 1 and less than or equal to its length. It checks this by iterating over the numbers from 2 to the length of the string and checking if the string is divisible by any of them. If it is, it returns False. If it is not, it returns True.

This code uses a set to keep track of the unique characters in each word.

Finally, it returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is non-empty. If the input list is empty, it will raise a ValueError.

 ### Questions:   Here is a possible implementation of the `search` function in Python 3:
```
def search(lst):
    # Find the smallest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency
    smallest_greater_than_zero = None
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] > 0 and lst[i] not in lst[:i]:
            smallest_greater_than_zero = lst[i]
            break

    # If no such integer exists, return None
    if smallest_greater_than_zero is None:
        return None

    # Find the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency
    greatest_greater_than_zero = None
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1, 0, -1):
        if lst[i] > 0 and lst[i] not in lst[i + 1:]:
            greatest_greater_than_zero = lst[i]
            break

    # If no such integer exists, return None
    if greatest_greater_than_zero is None:
        return None

    # Return the smallest or greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency
    if smallest_greater_than_zero < greatest_greater_than_zero:
        return smallest_greater_than_zero
    else:
        return greatest_greater_than_zero
```
This function first finds the smallest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency in the list. If no such integer exists, it returns `None`. Then, it finds the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency in the list. If no such integer exists, it returns `None`. Finally, it returns the smallest or greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency, depending on which one is smaller.

If `a` is not greater than `b`, it checks if `a` is even or odd. If `a` is even, it returns a list containing `a` and the result of recursively calling `generate_integers` with `a + 1` and `b`. If `a` is odd, it returns a list containing `a` and the result of recursively calling `generate_integers` with `a + 1` and `b`. The `*` operator is used to unpack the list returned by the recursive call and concatenate it with the list containing `a`.

On the other hand, `candidate(1, 4)` will return `False` because `1 ** 4` is equal to `1`, which is not equal to `1`.

`candidate(2, 2)` will return `False` because `2 ** 2` is equal to `4`, which is not equal to `2`.

`candidate(8, 2)` will return `False` because `8 ** 2` is equal to `64`, which is not equal to `8`.

  Here is the Python code for the `candidate` function:
```
def candidate(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    return min(strings, key=len)
```
This code uses the `min` function with the `key` argument set to `len` to find the shortest string in the list. If the list is empty, it returns `None`.

Alternatively, you can use the `sorted` function with the `key` argument set to `len` to sort the list of strings by length, and then return the first element of the sorted list:
```
def candidate(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    return sorted(strings, key=len)[0]
```
This code is similar to the previous one, but it uses the `sorted` function instead of the `min` function.

Next, it checks if `x` is less than `base`. If it is, it returns the string representation of `x`. If it is not, it recursively calls itself with `x // base` and `y`, and concatenates the result with the string representation of `x % base`.

Finally, it returns the concatenated string.

Note that this function assumes that `x` and `y` are integers, and that `base` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If these assumptions are not met, the function may raise a `TypeError` or `ValueError`.

This code checks if all keys in the dictionary are either all lower case or all upper case. If the dictionary is empty or if there are both lower and upper case keys, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

Note: The code assumes that all keys in the dictionary are strings. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code to handle other types of keys.

This code uses a list comprehension to generate the derivative of the polynomial. It starts by checking if the input list has only one element, in which case the derivative is an empty list. Otherwise, it generates the derivative by multiplying each coefficient by its index and adding them together.

Note that this code assumes that the input list represents a polynomial in the form `a_0 + a_1 * x + a_2 * x^2 + ...`, where `a_i` are the coefficients of the polynomial. If the input list does not represent a polynomial in this form, the code may not work correctly.

This function takes a single argument `n`, which is a positive integer. It returns `True` if `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 even numbers, and `False` otherwise.

For example, if `n = 12`, then `12` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 even numbers: `12 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2`. Therefore, the function will return `True`.

On the other hand, if `n = 13`, then `13` cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 even numbers. Therefore, the function will return `False`.

  ```
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    return words[-1]
```

This code uses the `split()` method to split the sentence into a list of words, and then returns the last word in the list using the `-1` index.

Alternatively, you could use the `rsplit()` method to split the sentence from the right, which would give you the last word in the sentence:
```
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    return sentence.rsplit()[-1]
```
This code is more concise and easier to read, but it may not be as efficient as the previous solution if the sentence is very long.

  Here is the Python 3 code that satisfies the given specifications:

def candidate(x: int, y: int):
    return pow(2, x, y)
```
This code uses the built-in `pow()` function to calculate the value of `2^x modulo y`. The `pow()` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is `2`, the exponent is `x`, and the modulus is `y`. The `pow()` function returns the result of the calculation, which is the value of `2^x modulo y`.

Note that the `pow()` function can also take a fourth argument, `z`, which specifies the starting point for the calculation. However, in this case, we do not need to specify `z` because the default value of `z` is `0`, which is the starting point we want.

  It seems like you are trying to write a function that counts the number of positive integers of length n, where the first digit is 1 and the last digit is 0.

Here's a possible implementation in Python:
```
def starts_one_ends(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1)):
        if str(i).startswith('1') and str(i).endswith('0'):
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function uses a loop to iterate over all possible positive integers of length n, and checks if each integer starts with 1 and ends with 0. If both conditions are met, the count is incremented.

Note that this function assumes that n is a positive integer. If n is not a positive integer, the function will raise a ValueError.

Also, this function uses the `str.startswith()` and `str.endswith()` methods to check if the first and last characters of the integer are 1 and 0, respectively. These methods return a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met or not.

This code uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the string `s`. For each character, it checks if it is an uppercase vowel using the `isupper()` method and the `in` operator. If it is, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable.

  It seems like you are trying to write a function that sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the sum of the first and last elements of the array. However, the function is not complete and there are some issues with the logic.

```
def sort_array(array):

        return sorted(array)

```
This function first checks if the array is empty. If it is, it returns the empty array.

Next, it gets the first and last elements of the array and checks if the sum of these elements is odd or even. If the sum is odd, it sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. If the sum is even, it sorts the array in descending order using the `sorted()` function with the `reverse` parameter set to `True`.

Note that the `sorted()` function returns a new sorted array, so we need to return the sorted array in the function.

  The given function `candidate` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all numbers up to `n`. The function is implemented using a loop that iterates from 1 to `n` and adds each number to the sum.

Here is the Python 3 code for the function:
```
def candidate(n: int):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum += i

This code uses a loop to iterate from 1 to `n` and adds each number to the sum. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the `+=` operator is used to add each number to the sum. The `sum` variable is initialized to 0 and is updated in each iteration of the loop.

The function is tested using the `doctest` module, which allows you to write test cases as docstrings. The test cases are written using the `>>>` prompt, which indicates that the following line is a test case. The `doctest` module will execute the test cases and compare the output to the expected output.

Here is an example of how to use the `doctest` module to test the `candidate` function:

If it is not, it appends the character to `result`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the result string and a boolean indicating whether the result string is a palindrome.

Note that the `result == result[::-1]` check is used to determine if the result string is a palindrome. This is because the `==` operator checks if the two strings are equal, and the `[::-1]` slice notation reverses the string. So, if the result string is equal to its reverse, it must be a palindrome.

This function takes a string `s` as input, and returns the decoded string by shifting every character by 3 in the opposite direction of the `encode_shift` function.

Note that the `ord` function is used to get the ASCII code of each character in the input string, and the `chr` function is used to convert the ASCII code back to a character. The `% 26` operation is used to ensure that the resulting character is within the range of the alphabet (i.e., between 'a' and 'z').

  Here is the Python3 code for the given problem:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = s.split("and")
    apples = int(apples.strip())
    oranges = int(oranges.strip())
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code first splits the input string `s` into two parts using the `and` keyword as the delimiter. It then converts the first part to an integer and the second part to an integer, and calculates the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket. Finally, it returns the number of mangoes.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers. If the input string is in a different format, the code may need to be modified accordingly

!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1st CodeLLM response:
  Here is the Python code for the `max_element` function:
```
def max_element(l: list):
    return max(l)
```
This code uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum element in the list. The `max` function takes a list as an argument and returns the largest element in the list.

Alternatively, you can use a loop to find the maximum element in the list:
```
def max_element(l: list):
    max_val = None
    for i in l:
        if max_val is None or i > max_val:
            max_val = i
    return max_val
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over the elements of the list and compare each element to the current maximum value. If the current element is greater than the current maximum value, it becomes the new maximum value. The function returns the maximum value at the end of the loop.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1st CodeLLM response:
  Based on the function signature and the description, it seems like the function is intended to return the length of the longest palindrome substring in the given string.

Here's an example implementation in Python 3:
```
def candidate(string: str) -> int:
    longest_palindrome = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
        for j in range(i, len(string)):
            if string[i:j+1] == string[j:i-1:-1]:
                longest_palindrome = string[i:j+1]
    return len(longest_palindrome)
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible substrings of the input string, and checks if each substring is a palindrome. If a palindrome is found, it is stored in the `longest_palindrome` variable. The length of the longest palindrome is then returned.

Note that this implementation is not the most efficient, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. A more efficient implementation would use a dynamic programming approach, which would have a time complexity of O(n^2).

!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1st CodeLLM response:
  It looks like you are trying to write a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first `n` positive integers. Here is an example of how you could do this in Python:
```
def candidate(n: int):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))
```
This function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, and then uses the `sum` function to add them all up. The `+1` in the `range` function is necessary because the `range` function is exclusive of the upper bound, so we need to add 1 to get the correct number of integers.

Alternatively, you could use a loop to iterate over the first `n` positive integers and add them up manually:
```
def candidate(n: int):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total += i
    return total
```
This function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the first `n` positive integers, and adds each one to a running total. The `+=` operator is used to add each integer to the total.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1st CodeLLM response:
  It seems like you are trying to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers. The string represents multiple groups of nested parentheses, and each group is separated by certain characters.

Here's an example of how you could implement this function in Python:
```
def candidate(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    # Split the string into a list of groups
    groups = paren_string.split('|')

    # Initialize an empty list to store the output
    output = []

    # Iterate over each group
    for group in groups:
        # Count the number of open and closed parentheses in the group
        open_count = 0
        closed_count = 0
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                open_count += 1
            elif char == ')':
                closed_count += 1

        # If the number of open and closed parentheses is the same, add the group to the output
        if open_count == closed_count:
            output.append(open_count)

    # Return the output list
    return output
```
This function uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of groups, and then iterates over each group to count the number of open and closed parentheses. If the number of open and closed parentheses is the same, the group is added to the output list. Finally, the output list is returned.

Note that this function assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning that it contains only valid parentheses and separators. If the input string is not well-formed, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an error.

 ### Questions:   Here is the Python code for the encode function:
```
def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 
    """
    # Swap case of all letters
    message = message.swapcase()

    # Replace all vowels with the letter that appears 
    vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
    for vowel in vowels:
        message = message.replace(vowel, vowel.upper())

    return message
```
This function takes a message as input, and returns the encoded message. It first swaps the case of all letters in the message using the `swapcase()` method. Then, it replaces all vowels in the message with the letter that appears in the same position in the uppercase version of the message. For example, if the message is "hello", the encoded message would be "HELLO".

!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1st CodeLLM response:
  This is a classic problem in computer science known as the "Two Car Problem". The problem is to determine the number of collisions that will occur between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on a straight road.

Here is a Python3 implementation of the function:
```
def is_prime(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. It starts by checking whether the number is less than or equal to 1, since all numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks whether the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime. Otherwise, it returns False.

Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, it will raise a ValueError.

 ### Questions:   Here is the Python3 code for the Tribonacci sequence:
```
def tribonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 3
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 1 + n / 2
    else:
        return tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n - 3)
```
This code uses the recurrence relation provided in the problem statement to generate the Tribonacci sequence. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th term of the sequence.

Note that this code assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

  ```
def candidate(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return bin(int(a, 2) | int(b, 2))[2:]
```
This code uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to combine the two input strings, which are converted to integers using the `int` function with a base of 2. The resulting integer is then converted back to a string using the `bin` function, and the leading `0b` is removed using slicing.

Note that this code assumes that the input strings only contain the characters `0` and `1`, and that the strings are of equal length. If these assumptions are not met, the code may produce incorrect results or raise an exception.

  Here is the Python 3 code for the given task:

def reverse_delete(s, c):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char not in c:
            result += char
    return (result, result == result[::-1])
```
This code first creates an empty string `result` to store the result of the deletion. Then it iterates through each character in `s` and checks if it is not in `c`. If it is not in `c`, it appends the character to `result`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the result string and a boolean indicating whether the result string is a palindrome.

Note that the `result == result[::-1]` check is used to determine if the result string is a palindrome. This is because the `==` operator checks if the two strings are equal, and the `[::-1]` slice notation reverses the string. So, if the result string is equal to its reverse, it must be a palindrome.

```
This code defines a function `get_odd_collatz` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a sorted list of the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence starting from `n`. The function uses a while loop to iterate through the sequence, and it checks if the current number is odd using the modulo operator. If the number is odd, it is added to the list. The function then updates the current number to the next number in the sequence using the Collatz function. The function returns the sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.

Note that the Collatz function is defined as follows: if the current number is even, the next number is half of the current number. If the current number is odd, the next number is 3 times the current number plus 1.

This code uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicates from the input array, and then returns the length of the resulting set. The `set` data structure is a collection of unique elements, so by removing duplicates, we are left with a set of unique numbers. The length of this set is the number of unique numbers in the input array.

Alternatively, you could use a list comprehension to filter out duplicates and then return the length of the resulting list:
```
def specialFilter(nums):
    return len([x for x in nums if x not in set(nums)])
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input array and filter out any duplicates. The resulting list is then passed to the `len` function to return the length of the list.

  Here is the Python3 code that satisfies the requirements:
```
def candidate(nums):

```
Explanation:

* The `sorted()` function takes an iterable and a key function as arguments. The key function is used to determine the order of the elements in the iterable.
* In this case, we use the `abs()` function to get the absolute value of each element in the list. This ensures that the elements are sorted in ascending order.
* The `lambda` function is used to define an anonymous function that takes a single argument `x` and returns its absolute value.
* The `key` argument of the `sorted()` function is set to the anonymous function defined by the `lambda` function.
* The `sorted()` function returns a new list with the elements sorted in the order determined by the key function.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is a list of integers. If the input list contains other types of elements, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string, and for each character that is lowercase, it replaces it with its uppercase equivalent. The resulting list of characters is then joined into a string using the `join` method.

Alternatively, you could use the `translate` method to achieve the same result:

This function takes a hexadecimal number as a string and returns the number of hexadecimal digits in the string.

For example, if `num` is `"AB"`, the function returns `1`, because there is only one hexadecimal digit in the string. If `num` is `"1077E"`, the function returns `2`, because there are two hexadecimal digits in the string. And so on.

Note that the function uses the `//` operator to perform integer division, which returns the integer part of the result. This is necessary because the length of a hexadecimal string is always an integer, and we want to return an integer value.

  ```
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
    return "".join(c for c in text if c not in vowels)
```
This code uses a set of vowels to keep track of which characters to remove from the input string. The `join` method is used to concatenate the remaining characters into a new string.

  Here is a possible implementation of the `fibfib` function in Python 3:
```
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)
```
This implementation uses a recursive approach, where the function calls itself with the arguments `n-1`, `n-2`, and `n-3`. The base cases are handled by the `if` statements, which return the appropriate values for `n=0`, `n=1`, and `n=2`.

Note that this implementation is not very efficient, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the repeated calls to `fibfib`. A more efficient implementation would use memoization or dynamic programming to avoid recomputing the same values multiple times.
