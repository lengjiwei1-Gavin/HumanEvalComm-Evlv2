def candidate(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to choose one from or concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    candidate(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    candidate([')', ')']) == 'No'

    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two

    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
