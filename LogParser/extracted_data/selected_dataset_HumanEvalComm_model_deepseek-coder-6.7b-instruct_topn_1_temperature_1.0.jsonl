Here is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef hex_key(num):\n    return len(set(num))\n```\n\nThis function works by converting the input hexadecimal number into a set of unique characters. The `set` function in Python removes any duplicate characters from the input string, and the `len` function returns the number of unique characters in the set.\n\nPlease note that this function is case-sensitive. If you want it to treat \"A\" and \"a\" as the same character, you can convert the input to lower case before counting the unique characters:\n\n```python\ndef hex_key(num):\n    return len(set(num.lower()))\n```\n\nThis will ensure that \"A\" and \"a\" are treated as the same character.", "Modified Description": "def hex_key(num):\n    \"\"\"You have been tasked to write a function that receives \n    a hexadecimal number as a string\n    Examples:\n    For num = \"AB\" the output should be 1.\n    For num = \"1077E\" the output should be 2.\n    For num = \"ABED1A33\" the output should be 4.\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\" the output should be 6.\n    For num = \"2020\" the output should be 2.\n    \"\"\"", "Original Description": "def hex_key(num):\n    \"\"\"You have been tasked to write a function that receives \n    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal \n    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number \n    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).\n    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\n    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...\n    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, \n    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).\n    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, \n    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.\n    Examples:\n    For num = \"AB\" the output should be 1.\n    For num = \"1077E\" the output should be 2.\n    For num = \"ABED1A33\" the output should be 4.\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\" the output should be 6.\n    For num = \"2020\" the output should be 2.\n    \"\"\"", "Evaluator Quality Score": "3", "Evaluator Answer": "The original problem description states that the function should count the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes, specifically 2, 3, 5, 7, B, and D."}
